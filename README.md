# launchly-quick-post

launch.ly Quick Post allows you to create a form inside a snippet to allow you to quickly create an item, contents and links.

## Requirements

This sample depends on these projects ... 

- [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

## How it works

By having a simple form added to your snippet, you will be able to quickly create a new item immediately, right where you want it. The quick post feature of [launch.ly](http://launch.ly) will then create a new item for you, add a single piece of content to your new item and create links based on your title.

## Installation

Add the snippet.html code to the template part of your snippet and also add the javascript to the javascript tab of the same snippet. If you like, add in the css as well to make it pretty.
